          <h1>Disparate Impact</h1>
          <p><b>Machine learning</b>(<i>ML</i>) is commonly used to make decisions in practice. For example, in a loan case, banks often decide to approve or deny a borrower with the assistance of <i>ML</i> models, with the borrower's information as the input of the <i>ML</i> model, such as age, gender, employment, etc. However, it turned out that the ML model can be biased in a way that the model is more likely to approve the loan of male borrowers than female borrowers, even though they have a similar background. 
            In this section, we aim to learn a popular fairness metric, called <b>Disparate Impact</b>, to mathematically measure the fairness of a <i>ML</i> model.</p>
          <p>
            Before that, we need to learn the <b>confusion matrix</b> first. The confusion matrix enables the comparison between the predictions of the <i>ML</i> model and the actual outcome (ground truth) on a data set. Confusion matrices are in the form of a $2*2$ matrix, as shown below. The rows represent the ground truth — i.e., the number of people who got approved for the loan ($p$) and the number of people who were denied ($n$). Columns represent the number of people the model predicted were approved for the loan $p’$ and how many were denied $n’$. 
            Each of the $4$ cells represents the number of times predictions matched or mismatched with the ground truth.

            <li><b>True positive</b> ($TP$) = model correctly predicts loan was approved</li>
            <li><b>False negative</b> ($FN$) = model says deny loan, but the loan was actually approved</li>
            <li><b>False positive</b> ($FP$) = model predicts approval the loan, but the loan was actually denied</li>
            <li><b>True negative</b> ($TN$) = model correctly predicts loan was denied</li>
